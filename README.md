Calculist

by Dan Gallagher

This application was created to serve the need of those who need to make many simple calculations and require a pen and paper to write down any of the numbers that were calculated as to not forget them. This app allows you to make a calculation and then choose to log it to a list. After it is pushed to the list you can name the calculation, move it up or down, or delete it.

Hope you enjoy this.
